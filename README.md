# Brick Breaker

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<P>This project is a brick breaker game. There will be many levels with different difficulties (in the arrangement of the bricks and number of hits it will take to beat each brick), and each level must be beat in order to move on. However, there will be lives, so the game will end when all the levels have been beat or all the lives are over.</P>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<P>I really like playing brick breaker, and I have played many versions of it, so I thought it would be nice to create my own brick breaker game to play.</P>
